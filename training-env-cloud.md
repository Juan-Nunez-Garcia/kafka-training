# Kafka Training Environment
[⬅️ Back to Kafka overview](README.md)


This training comes with a predefined environment provided in multiple docker containers. 

## Technical prerequisite for the training

The following service components should be installed on your training device before attending the training:

* Development: 
  * VS Code (or your IDE/text editor of choice) 
  * Current Java JDK
  * Git
  * Maven (if not already included in IDE)
* Clone `git clone https://github.com/Zuehlke/kafka-streaming-technology.git` to your training device
* Optional: HTTP client to send requests like Postman


## Access to your environment

From your instructor you will get 
* the IP address of a cloud vm where your Kafka ecosystems run
* the ssh key that allows you to access your vm

## Configure your environment

### Modify your local hosts file (DNS entry)

Add the following entry in your hosts file:  `[ip of your VM] myVMsIP`
* Windows in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
* MAC in `/private/etc/hosts`

### SSH

For some exercises you need to login with ssh to your instance (the webconsole does not work as there are a limited number of consoles available):
* you got your ssh key by mail
* Login: `ssh -i [yourKey].pem -l ubuntu myVMsIP`
* in the case password protection is enforced, create a password-protected file: `openssl rsa -aes256 -in [yourKey].pem -out [yourProtectedKey].pem`


### Tool access

On your cloud endpoint, the follwing tools run to conduct the labs:
* AKHQ:            Custom TCP 8080 [your IP]
* Schema Registry: Custom TCP 8081 [your IP]
* Rest Proxy:      Custom TCP 8082 [your IP]
* Kafka Connect:   Custom TCP 8083 [your IP]
* phpMyAdmin:      Custom TCP 8085 [your IP]
* KSQL:            Custom TCP 8088 [your IP]
* Kafka Broker:    Custom TCP 9094 [your IP]
* MariaDB:         Custom TCP 3306 [your IP]

The access to this tools is restricted to your company network. To do the following tests, you need to connect to your company via VPN or run the tests in your company's office.


## Test your setup

### Test AKHQ
 * in your [browser](http://myVMsIP:8080): `myVMsIP:8080`

You should see the AKHQ Topics screen


### Test the setup of your local development environment

* In your IDE-Terminal or shell, change to the following directory: `$ cd uc-iot/kafka-stream/`
* Compile the sources: `~/kafka-streaming-technology/uc-iot/kafka-stream$ mvn compile`

```
~/kafka-streaming-technology/uc-iot/kafka-stream$ mvn compile
