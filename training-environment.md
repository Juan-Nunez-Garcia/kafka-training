# Kafka Training Environment
[‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back to Kafka overview](README.md)

## Training environment
This training comes with a predefined environment provided in multiple docker containers. 

## Windows with WSL 2.0 & Mac: Start the training environment
Open a shell and run the following commands to check out the course repository and start the environment.
```
git clone https://github.com/lfrei/kafka-training.git
cd kafka-training
docker-compose up -d
```

üí° Detailed instruction to **fulfill all system requirements** are described further down.
üí° If  Git is need to be installed on Ubuntu use the following command: 
```
sudo apt install -y git
```

Verification
To check things are up and running, execute the following command. There should be a list of running containers. The status should be up and healthy for all containers.
```
docker ps

```
In addition, you can visit http://localhost:8080/ and check if akHQ is running appropriately if you see the node here http://localhost:8080/ui/docker-kafka-server/node.


üí° The whole environment is quite main memory intensive. We recommend a computer with at least 16 GB of working memory. 

## Technical prerequisite for the training

The following service components should be installed on your training device before attending the training. A detailed installation guide will be given afterwards. 

* Docker Desktop
* Development: 
  * VS Code (or your IDE/text editor of choice) 
  * Current Java JDK
  * Git
  * Maven
* Optional: HTTP client to send requests like Postman

In addition, required for Windows users:
* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
* Ubuntu 20.04 for WSL (recommended, other distributions might work too)
* Windows Terminal (optional, but very nice)

## Step-by-Step Guide: Preparation of Notebook for Windows Users

Enable nested virtualization
Only required if running inside a VM
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization

Install WSL
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
In a shell with admin permissions run
```
wsl --install
```

Ensure you're running WSL 2 and not the legacy WSL 1
```
wsl --status
```

Example output
Default Distribution: Ubuntu
**Default Version: 2**

Windows Subsystem for Linux was last updated on 8 Nov 2021
WSL automatic updates are on.

Kernel version: 5.10.60.1

Install Windows Terminal (optional)
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install
Optional but very nice to use üòä

Install Ubuntu 20.04 from the Microsoft store
See https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N6SVWS3RX71 Alternative link: https://aka.ms/wslstore
You should now be able to run the Ubuntu app

![img.png](img/te_1.png)

or select the shell in the Windows Terminal

![img.png](img/te_2.png)

On first run you'll be asked to set up a user.

Install Docker Desktop
Note: If you plan on using Docker Desktop commercially, please ensure you sign up for a paid account. 
See https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

Enable WSL backend in Docker Desktop
Note: This is probably already your default if installed after WSL
![img.png](img/te_3.png)

Enable WSL integration in Docker Desktop
This is to enable direct access to Docker from your distribution and add the necessary binaries.

![img.png](img/te_4.png)

Confirm all changes to Docker Desktop with the press of ‚ÄúApply & Restart‚Äù

![img.png](img/te_6.png)

## Step-by-Step Guide: Preparation of Notebook for Mac Users

Install Docker Desktop
Note: If you plan on using Docker Desktop commercially, please ensure you sign up for a paid account.
See https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

For Mac you should choose 8 GB of memory like depicted in the picture.

## Troubleshooting
üí° All Docker Compose commands must be executed in the top folder of your training material.

Restart your environment: 
```
docker-compose restart
```
Stop and remove resources of your environment
```
docker-compose down
```

Delete your local persistent data:
```
docker volume rm kafka-training_db-leach kafka-training_db_conf kafka-training_db_data
```

Restart & Logs: You can use Docker Desktop to restart container and read logs. As an alternative you can use the command line.

```
# List all running container.
docker ps

# Example to restart Kafka Connect
docker restart kafka-connect-01

Print out all logs for Kafka Connect 
docker logs kafka-connect-01

# Follow the logs for Kafka Connect 
docker logs -f kafka-connect-01

```

Using WSL 2.0 and cannot connect to Kafka broker with Spring Boot. Error: *Bootstrap broker localhost (id : -1 rack: null) disconnected*
```
# Get the external interface IP adress on Ubuntu terminal
ip addr | grep eth0

#  Open PowerShell as a Administrator and add a port proxy
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=9092 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=9092 connectaddress=YOUR_IP_OF_EXTERNAL_INTERFACE
```
